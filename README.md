During my internship at Exposys Data Labs, I designed and developed a web-based application named the Website Mass-Mail Dispatcher. This application is engineered to facilitate the process of sending mass emails to recipients listed in a CSV file, offering a practical solution for managing large-scale email campaigns.the Website Mass-Mail Dispatcher offers a comprehensive tool to control and dispatch emails to vast numbers of recipients, enhancing both the efficiency and convenience of email marketing efforts.
